    <p>For my project 3, I will make a game that is controlled by the player using the mouse. They must dodge obstacles flying from the right of the screen to the left, and get the highest school by staying alive the longest. The player will start off on a menu screen where it’ll have them press a button with the mouse pointer and they’ll immediately start the game. They’ll lose if they give a wall or their mouse exits the game window. It’ll be something like this old scratch project I made a while back.</p>
