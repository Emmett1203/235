Hi my name is Emmett McEvoy. I'm a second year (as of spring 2024) GDD major. I'm a huge Sonic and Godzilla fan, and a big fan of video games in general, with my favorite game of all time being Rabbids go Home for the Wii. 
One of my personal hopes to get out of this class is the skills and knowledge to build my own webpage and use it as my protfolio, because I use wix for the site, and it is a pain to edit. Having full control over my website would be a dream come true (also I can add a bunch of goofy stuff and register the site with a .pizza). 
When I graduate I hope to work at a big game studio (Valve being my dream job) or working on my own indie games (most of them being about robots and shooting things). Also fixing my hair.
