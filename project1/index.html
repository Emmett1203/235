        <h2>Classic Toho Godzilla is back on the silver screens. This time, he isn't fighting another monster, this time, he's harrasing a traumatized WW2 suicide bomber.</h2>

                &emsp;Godzilla minus one, directed by Takashi Yamazaki, is the 37th Godzilla, and was made for the 70th anniversary of Godzilla. It was released in Japan on November 3rd 2024 and released in America in December 1st, with an estimated budget of about 10 million. 
                <br>&emsp;This Godzilla film is a return to Godzilla’s original film of him terrorizing post-WW2 Japan (about 10 years after WW2) instead of him in a more modern setting, fighting other giant monsters, or him being a horribly mutated beast from the last circle of hell. 
                <br>&emsp;This film follows a cowardly kamikaze pilot, Kōichi Shikishima, who has been traumatized from being one of the only two survivors of a not-as-giant monster (pre-nuclear-mutation Godzilla) attack on a Japanese base on Odo Island. As he returns to his home in Japan, he finds that his parents were killed in an air raid, and meets a girl who had found an orphaned baby. Together they both raise the child over time while Japan recovers, Kōichi gets a job exploding leftover naval mines from WW2, while still dealing with the survivor's guilt that Godzilla left him with. But he then finds out that Godzilla has been horrifically mutated from nuclear testing, and is now going to destroy Japan. 
                <br>&emsp;The movie really captures the horrors that Godzilla inflicts on normal citizens who are attacked by him on a very grounded sense. We see how Godzilla affects them in both a physical way and in an emotional way. We jump into characters' thoughts and feelings, which really helps you connect with them and hope that they’re able to pull through (not counting Godzilla since he's a big monster that wants them all dead).

                &emsp;The film is now quite infamous online for having such a small budget yet amazing effects, it had even recently won an Oscar for best visual effects, making it the first Godzilla movie to win an Oscar. In fact, when I first saw a clip of Godzilla minus one (Godzilla boat scene), I thought they’d used some form of practical effects since Godzilla just looked so damn good. 
                <br>&emsp;Another fun fact about the visuals. The director, Takashi Yamazaki, had worked on Godzilla before, with Godzilla appearing in the opening of  Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 (2007) and the Seibu-en Amusement Park's motion simulator attraction Godzilla the Ride: Giant Monsters Ultimate Battle (2021).

                &emsp;Overall, Godzilla Minus One is an amazing movie with amazing visuals, amazing characters, and an amazing homage to the 70-year-old who started it all, and I am extremely excited to see what Takashi Yamazaki has in store for the giant monster. From what he’s stated in interviews, he wants to do a sequel to Minus One, with it possibly being a monster fight movie. Which I absolutely am down for, since I am a huge fan of goofy Godzilla (also, super excited for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, looks like a grand time).
	            <br>&emsp;If you haven’t seen Godzilla Minus One, I wish I could say that you should stream it, but for some reason, it’s nowhere. You can’t even buy a DVD for it. So I guess just wait. But trust me it’ll be worth it.

        <h3>Godzilla movies in 2016</h3>
        <div class="footer-box">
          <div>&emsp;Another movie very similar to Godzilla minus one, (a Godzilla movie where Godzilla attacks humans) was released in 2016 by Toho, and marks the start of the "Reiwa era" (which is the era Godzilla Minus One is a part of. Eras being how Godzilla films are categorized).</div> 
          <div>&emsp;Shin Godzilla follows a Japanese task force trying to study this weird fish monster that has recently come ashore. As the film progresses, this weird bleeding mutated fish evolves into a freakish Godzilla with death in it's eyes, a weird head tail, and a huge atomic breath scene to match.</div> 
          <div>&emsp;Even though Godzilla in this film was computer animated, to mimic the movement style of older Godzilla movies, Godzilla's movments are actually motion capture.</div>
          <div>&emsp;The movie is honestly really good, but it does have a few issues, such as the slow start and at time weird effects, but overall it's really good, and a great step in the right direction that lead to minus one.</div>
