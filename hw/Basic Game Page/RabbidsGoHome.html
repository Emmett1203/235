<h2>From <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/03/rabbids-go-home-review">IGM</a>, Matt Casamassina, 8.5/10</h2>
<blockquote>
    If you haven't already realized, please take note: Rabbids Go Home is not a Raving Rabbids sequel, but an altogether different experience -- one far more inspired and ambitious. This title at times feels like an action romp and at times a platformer on wheels, but regardless of the scenario, you'll be having fun and smiling if not laughing. The presentation is generally polished (minus some stupidly long load times between areas) and the grocery cart-based controls are fluid and satisfying. What the game lacks in narrative arch and difficulty progression it makes up for with some hilarious Rabbid antics. Meanwhile, I found all the collecting engaging, not annoying -- but be warned that there's a lot of it.<br><br>
    I really think Ubisoft has a potential franchise on its hands with this one. I like the formulas in place and love the characters. Here's hoping it sells well so that we can see more of the Rabbids beyond the confines of mini-game compilations.
